      		<h1 id="You-Could-Be-Taxed-Up-To-45-On-Casino-Winnings-In-BGaming"><a href="#You-Could-Be-Taxed-Up-To-45-On-Casino-Winnings-In-BGaming" class="headerlink" title="You Could Be Taxed Up To 45% On Casino Winnings In BGaming"></a>You Could Be Taxed Up To 45% On Casino Winnings In BGaming</h1><p>Casino gambling in Bulgaria could lead to a 45 percent tax on winnings, the director of the State Lottery has said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s Finance Ministry is mulling over a new gambling law that would see casino operators taxed at a rate of 10 percent on revenue and 45 percent on winnings, Milen Velchev told reporters on Thursday, as cited by Focus news agency.</p>
<p>The new gambling law is expected to be tabled in Parliament in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, online gambling would also be taxed at 10 percent on revenue and 45 percent on winnings.</p>
<p>Revenue from land-based casinos amounted to BGN 97 million (€49 million) in 2016, while online gambling generated nearly BGN 300 million (€153 million),according to official figures.</p>
<h1 id="BGaming-Announces-New-Tax-Rates-For-Casino-Earnings"><a href="#BGaming-Announces-New-Tax-Rates-For-Casino-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="BGaming Announces New Tax Rates For Casino Earnings"></a>BGaming Announces New Tax Rates For Casino Earnings</h1><p>BGaming has announced new tax rates for casino earnings, which will come into effect on 1st January 2019. The new tax rates are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>24% for earnings up to €750,000</li>
<li>30% for earnings between €751,000 and €5,000,000</li>
<li>36% for earnings over €5,000,000</li>
</ul>
<p> BGaming CEO Konstantin Koltsov said: “These new tax rates reflect our commitment to providing a fair and equitable taxation system for our casino players. We believe that the new rates will help us to maintain our position as the world’s leading online casino operator.”</p>
<h1 id="BGaming-Introduces-Higher-Taxes-On-Casino-Winnings"><a href="#BGaming-Introduces-Higher-Taxes-On-Casino-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="BGaming Introduces Higher Taxes On Casino Winnings"></a>BGaming Introduces Higher Taxes On Casino Winnings</h1><p>In an effort to increase government revenue, BGaming has announced that it will be implementing higher taxes on casino winnings. The new tax rates will go into effect on January 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations, any individual who wins more than $5,000 in a single day at a casino will be required to pay a 35% tax on their winnings. This is up from the current rate of 25%.</p>
<p>The new tax rates will apply to both domestic and foreign players. In addition, BGaming has announced that it will be instituting a new 10% tax on casino profits. This is also up from the current rate of 5%.</p>
<p>BGaming says that the new taxes are necessary in order to help fund the government’s ambitious development plans. “We need to find new sources of revenue in order to finance our growth agenda,” said a spokesperson for BGaming. “The casino industry is a key part of our economy and we want to make sure that it remains healthy and vibrant.”</p>
<p>The gaming company also points out that the new taxes are in line with those implemented by other countries. For example, Canada imposes a 30% tax on casino winnings over CA$10,000 (US$7,650).</p>
<p>Opposition parties have criticized BGaming’s decision, saying that it will hurt the casino industry and cost jobs. But the government insists that the new taxes are necessary in order to improve the country’s economic prospects.</p>
<h1 id="BGaming-Tightens-Tax-Laws-For-Casino-Earnings"><a href="#BGaming-Tightens-Tax-Laws-For-Casino-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="BGaming Tightens Tax Laws For Casino Earnings"></a>BGaming Tightens Tax Laws For Casino Earnings</h1><p>BGaming has announced a new set of tax laws for casino earnings. The new law, which comes into effect on January 1st, will see casino operators taxed at a rate of 15% on all earnings.</p>
<p>The move is seen as an attempt by BGaming to clamp down on tax avoidance among casino operators. BGaming has come under increasing pressure in recent months to introduce tighter tax laws, with several high profile cases of tax avoidance in the industry.</p>
<p>Under the new laws, operators will be required to pay 15% tax on all profits generated from casinos, regardless of their location. The new law will also apply to operators who use third-party platforms to run their casinos.</p>
<p>BGaming has defended the move, arguing that it will help to ensure that casino profits are taxed fairly. “We believe that this new law will help ensure a level playing field for all casino operators,” said a spokesperson for BGaming. “It is important that we all pay our fair share of taxes and this new law will help to make sure that happens.”</p>
<p>The move is likely to be welcomed by regulators and governments around the world who have been calling for tougher action against tax avoidance in the casino industry. It is also likely to be welcomed by consumers who have been calling for increased transparency and regulation in the industry.</p>
<h1 id="BGaming-Collects-More-Taxes-From-Casino-Winnings"><a href="#BGaming-Collects-More-Taxes-From-Casino-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="BGaming Collects More Taxes From Casino Winnings"></a>BGaming Collects More Taxes From Casino Winnings</h1><p>BGaming, a Maltese-licensed online casino, has announced it will start collecting taxes from its players’ winnings. The move comes as the company looks to expand its operations and pass on the costs of compliance to its customers.</p>
<p> BGaming joins a number of other online casinos in implementing such a policy, including Casino Superlines and Dublin Bet. Players at those sites are now required to provide their tax identification number (TIN) before they can withdraw any winnings.</p>
<p>Taxes on casino winnings vary by jurisdiction, but they typically range from 15% to 30%. BGaming says it will charge a flat 25% rate on all winnings above €1,000.</p>
<p>The new policy is sure to dismay some players, who may feel that they are being unfairly penalized for enjoying a bit of good luck. Others may simply find the added administrative burden too onerous.</p>
<p>But BGaming insists that the move is necessary in order to maintain its high level of compliance with regulations. The company also points out that players can still enjoy tax-free winnings if their gambling activities fall within certain parameters set by their local authorities.</p>
