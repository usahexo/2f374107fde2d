#  Nevada Legalizes Online Gambling; Industry Expects Billions in Revenue

On Tuesday, February 26th, the Nevada state legislature passed a bill legalizing online gambling within the state’s borders. The bill had wide bipartisan support, passing in the Senate on a unanimous vote and in the Assembly by a margin of nearly three to one.

Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law within days, and the Nevada Gaming Commission has already released draft regulations governing the new industry.

Industry analysts expect that online gambling will generate billions of dollars in revenue for Nevada casinos over the next several years. Augustine Frizzell of the law firm Greenberg Traurig said, “This could be a game changer for the casino industry in Nevada. It will provide a new and exciting experience for customers and should lead to increased visitation and spending at Nevada casinos.”

Online gambling is currently legal in only three states: Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada. But other states are expected to legalize it in the coming years as they seek to recapture some of the $6 billion that is estimated to be wagered online each year by U.S. residents.

Nevada’s move to legalize online gambling comes as no surprise; the state has been a pioneer in gaming innovation for decades. In 1931, it became the first state to legalize casino gambling. In 1955, it opened up Las Vegas – then an undeveloped desert area – to casino development, and it has been leading the gaming industry ever since.

The first legal online poker site went live in Nevada in April 2013, and there are now dozens of such sites operating within the state’s borders.

#  NJ Governor Signs Bill Legalizing Online Gambling

On Thursday, October 26th, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that legalizes online gambling in the state. This makes New Jersey the third US state to legalize online gambling, after Delaware and Nevada.

The new law allows licensed casinos in New Jersey to offer online gambling services to residents of the state. These services will include casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots, as well as sports betting.

According to Gov. Christie, the new law will help create jobs and generate revenue for the state. He also stated that it will help keep New Jersey's casinos competitive with those in other states.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. However, supporters say that it can be safely managed if done responsibly.

Nevada was the first US state to legalize online gambling, doing so in 2013. In 2015, Delaware became the second state to do so.

#  Delaware Allows Online Gambling; First State to Authorize Full-Scale Gaming

On June 11, 2018, Delaware became the first U.S. state to authorize full-scale online gambling. In addition to poker and casino games, the law allows for fantasy sports contests and sports betting.

The passage of House Bill 325 was opposed by a number of groups, including the American Gaming Association (AGA), which represents commercial casinos in the United States. But Governor John Carney, who signed the bill into law, said that it would provide a new revenue stream for the state without cannibalizing its brick-and-mortar casinos.

"This is an important day for Delaware," said Governor Carney in a statement. "Expanding gaming to include online products will help us grow our economy and create new jobs."

Governor Carney isn't the only one who is bullish on online gambling in Delaware. A recent study by Econsult Solutions Inc. predicted that the industry could generate as much as $9 million in annual tax revenue for the state. That's a welcome development for a state that has been struggling with budget deficits in recent years.

Gambling opponents argue that legalizing online gambling will lead to more addiction and social problems. But those concerns have not been borne out in other states that have legalized it. In fact, many experts believe that regulated online gambling is actually safer than traditional gambling because it is more tightly controlled.

Delaware's move could inspire other states to follow suit, especially now that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down a federal ban on sports betting. Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are all likely candidates to legalize online gambling in the coming years.

#  California Poised to Legalize Online Poker

On July 17, 2019, the California Senate voted in favor of Assembly Bill. 463, which would legalize and regulate online poker in the state.

The bill now heads to the desk of Governor Gavin Newsom, who is expected to sign it into law. Once enacted, the new law will establish a regulatory framework for licensed operators to offer online poker to residents of California.

AB 463 was introduced by Assemblyman Adam Gray in February of this year. The bill has been through several iterations and has been amended multiple times to address concerns raised by lawmakers and other stakeholders.

One key amendment prohibits operators from offering any other form of gambling alongside poker. This provision was included in response to concerns that the legalization of online poker could lead to an expansion of casino-style gambling in California.

Another amendment allows for the sharing of player data between licensed poker operators. This will help to ensure a level playing field among operators and prevent cheating and collusion.

The passage of AB 463 marks a significant development in the ongoing effort to legalize online poker in California. The state is home to over 38 million residents, making it one of the largest potential markets for online poker in the world.

If Governor Newsom signs AB 463 into law, it will be only the second state (after Nevada) to legalize and regulate online poker. Other states, including New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are also considering bills that would legalize online poker.

#  Pennsylvania Becomes Fourth State to Legalize Online Gambling

It was announced on October 26th that Pennsylvania had legalized online gambling. The bill, which was passed in the state House and Senate, will allow casinos in the state to offer online slots, table games, and poker to players within the borders of Pennsylvania. This makes Pennsylvania the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling after New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf is expected to sign the bill into law, which would make gambling sites available as early as this winter. Gamblers within Pennsylvania will be able to access these sites through their computers or mobile devices; however, they will not be able to gamble on sports.

The main reason for legalizing online gambling in Pennsylvania is to help generate more revenue for the state government. In fiscal year 2017-2018, casino taxes generated $378 million in revenue for Pennsylvania; however, it is estimated that legalizing online gambling could bring in an additional $100 million per year. This money would go towards funding education and social programs in the state.

There are some restrictions that come with this new law; for example, only land-based casinos in Pennsylvania will be able to offer online gambling services, and players must be physically located within the state borders to participate. Casino owners have expressed concerns about player collusion and fraud, but these issues are still being worked out.

So far, three casinos have stated their intention of offering online gambling services: Parx Casino Resort near Philadelphia, SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia, and Rivers Casino Pittsburgh. It is expected that many more casinos will follow suit in order to take advantage of this new market.
