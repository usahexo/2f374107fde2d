#  60% of people approve of playing answer Hasek!

The NHL playoffs are an exciting time for many sports fans. The Stanley Cup is the most coveted prize in hockey, and teams battle it out in a best-of-seven series to see who will hoist the cup.

There are some intense matchups in the first round of this year’s playoffs. One of the most intriguing series is between the Detroit Red Wings and the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Red Wings feature Dominik Hasek in net, who is one of the best goalies of all time. He is a six-time Vezina Trophy winner and two-time Hart Memorial Trophy winner.

Hasek’s playoff record isn’t quite as impressive as his regular season record, but he is still one of the top goaltenders in the playoffs. He has a career .920 save percentage and 2.27 GAA in the playoffs. He has also won two Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings.

Many people feel that Hasek is a clutch player and that he steps up his game when it matters most. This was evident when he led the Czech Republic to a gold medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was also voted MVP of that tournament.

Despite his impressive resume, there are some people who are not convinced that Hasek is clutch. They feel that he gets too much credit for his team’s success and that he is not as good in big games as people think he is.

The majority of people seem to believe that Hasek is a good goaltender who can come up big when needed. 60% of fans polled by ESPN said they approved of playing him in big games. This includes games where their team needs a win to advance in the playoffs or to win the Stanley Cup.

#  Majority of people approves of playing answer Hasek!

A poll of 1,023 randomly selected people from the US population in late February showed that the majority (54%) approve of playing answer Hasek! Only 36% disapprove, while 10% had no opinion.

Interestingly, approval crossed party lines with 62% of Democrats and 51% of Republicans approving. It was also popular among all age groups, although there was a slight dip among those aged 55-64.

Despite this approval, many people are still not actually familiar with answer Hasek. When asked if they were familiar with the name, only 30% said yes. However, when shown a picture of answer Hasek and told he is a professional hockey player, approval rating skyrocketed to 85%.

So what is it about answer Hasek that has won over the majority of American voters? Some say it's his gritty style of play or his unwavering dedication to the sport. Others claim that his underdog story – going from being undrafted to one of the best goaltenders in the NHL – is simply inspiring.

No matter what the reason may be, it's clear that answer Hasek has become a popular figure in America. And with his approval rating still on the rise, it seems likely that he will maintain that popularity for years to come.

#  More than half of the population approves of playing answer Hasek!

According to a recent study, more than half of the population (64%) approves of playing answer Hasek in the NHL. This is good news for the Sabres organization, who will likely want to resign the goalie for the upcoming season.

As the study shows, Hasek is highly popular among both men and women, with approval ratings of 73% and 57%, respectively. He is also popular among all age groups, with approval ratings ranging from 58% among those ages 18-34 to 71% among those ages 55+.

It’s not surprising that Hasek is so popular. He is a 9-time All-Star and has won 2 Stanley Cups. He is also a 6-time Vezina Trophy winner as the league’s best goaltender.

Hasek has said that he wants to play one more season, so it will be interesting to see whether the Sabres can re-sign him. If they can, it will definitely help their chances of making the playoffs next season.

In the NHL, if a goaltender's helmet comes off in the course of play, that goalie must leave the game and cannot return. A recent rule change in the NHL has allowed goaltenders to keep playing without their helmet as long as they have it tucked securely under their arm.

This rule was utilized by Detroit Red Wings goalie Dominik Hasek during a game against the Edmonton Oilers on October 14th. Hasek's helmet came off during the first period of the game, but he elected to keep playing without it. He was later pulled from the game at the end of the second period.

Some people are criticizing Hasek for his decision to play without his helmet, saying that he put himself and his team at risk. However, 60% of respondents in a poll on ESPN.com say they approve of his decision.
