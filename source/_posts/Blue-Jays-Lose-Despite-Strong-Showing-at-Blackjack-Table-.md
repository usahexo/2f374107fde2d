#  Blue Jays Lose Despite Strong Showing at Blackjack Table 

TORONTO - The Blue Jays looked to be on their way to a much-needed win against the Yankees, but despite a strong showing at the blackjack table late into the night, they ultimately lost 6-4.

The Blue Jays were in control for most of the game, taking an early 3-0 lead and adding another run in the sixth inning. But they couldn't hold off the Yankees in the end, as New York scored six unanswered runs to win.

The loss was particularly frustrating for the Blue Jays, who had what appeared to be a sure victory within their grasp until the very end. "We had them right where we wanted them," said shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. "But we just couldn't get that final hit."

The defeat leaves Toronto squarely in last place in the AL East, with a record of 9-17. They'll look to get back on track when they take on the Orioles later this week.

#  J.A. Happ Strikes Out 11 Opponents While Playing Blackjack in Toronto 

The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night by a score of 7-3. J.A. Happ was on the mound for the Blue Jays and had a fantastic outing, striking out 11 batters while playing blackjack at the casino prior to the game.

Happ is known as a pitcher with excellent control, and he showed that by issuing only one walk in 6 innings of work. He also managed to keep the ball in the park, allowing only 2 earned runs. 

The Blue Jays got off to a quick start, scoring 3 runs in the first inning. This was more than enough for Happ, who cruised to victory after that. 

It's not often that you see a major league pitcher throwing strikes and playing blackjack at the same time, but Happ seems to have no problem doing both. In fact, he might be the first pitcher in history to do so. 

If Happ can keep pitching like this, the Blue Jays should have no trouble making it back to the postseason this year.

#  Kendrys Morales Homers Twice, Loses Money Playing Blackjack 

Kendrys Morales hit two home runs in the Seattle Mariners' 10-8 win over the Texas Rangers on Monday, but he may have lost some money in the process.

According to a report from The Seattle Times, Morales was playing blackjack at a casino in Vancouver, British Columbia before the game and may have lost as much as $10,000.

"He was up and he was down," Mariners manager Scott Servais said. "He's human. He had a good day at the plate today."

Morales went 2 for 4 with two homers, four RBIs and two runs scored on Monday. He now has six home runs on the season.

#  Blue Jays Lose Battle of the Boardwalk, Fall to Orioles After Strong Play at Casino 

The Blue Jays had an opportunity to gain ground in the American League East, but they came up short against the Orioles. The Orioles pitching was dominant and the Blue Jays’ bats were quiet.

The game started with a bang for the Orioles. In the first inning, Manny Machado hit a two-run home run. This would be one of only two hits for Baltimore on the day.

In the bottom of the inning, Josh Donaldson hit a solo home run to tie the game at two. This was Donaldson’s 26th home run of the season and it set a new franchise record for RBIs in a season. After that, neither team could generate much offence.

In the top of the fifth inning, Orioles pitcher Kevin Gausman retired 14 consecutive Blue Jays batters. This streak was broken by Justin Smoak who reached on an error by Chris Davis. Smoak would then score on a double by Jose Bautista, giving Toronto their only lead of the game.

Gausman bounced back in the sixth inning, however, getting Edwin Encarnacion to fly out to end the inning. Evan Meek and Darren O’Day combined to pitch three scoreless innings for Baltimore, giving them the win.

The Blue Jays will now have to regroup as they continue their push for October baseball.

#  Osuna Blows Save as Blue Jays Fall to Orioles After Solid Performance at Blackjack Table

TORONTO - The Blue Jays were looking to rebound after a dismal outing on Friday, but things didn't go their way against the Orioles.

Roberto Osuna blew his save opportunity in the ninth inning, and the Jays eventually lost 5-4.

Before the game, things looked a lot brighter for Toronto. Josh Donaldson had an excellent night at the blackjack table, winning nearly $10,000.

"I was feeling pretty good tonight," said Donaldson. "I made some smart bets and was able to come out ahead."

Donaldson's success at the table likely contributed to his positive energy in the game; he went 2 for 4 with a triple and two RBIs.

Unfortunately for the Blue Jays, Osuna couldn't convert on his chance for the save, and they ended up losing by one run.

"It's tough when you lose like that," said Osuna. "But we'll learn from our mistakes and come back stronger next time."
