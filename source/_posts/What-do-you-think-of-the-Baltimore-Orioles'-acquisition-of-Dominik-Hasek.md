#  What do you think of the Baltimore Orioles' acquisition of Dominik Hasek?

On July 11, 2001, the Baltimore Orioles acquired Dominik Hasek from the Detroit Tigers. Many people thought that this was a good move for the Orioles, as Hasek was one of the best pitchers in the league.

Hasek had an impressive career prior to joining the Orioles. He had been named an All-Star six times and had won two Vezina Trophies. He was also a two-time Olympic gold medalist.

Despite his success, Hasek struggled with the Orioles. He posted a 5.09 ERA in 54 innings pitched and went 3-7 with the team. The Orioles released him midway through the 2002 season.

Overall, I think that the Orioles' acquisition of Dominik Hasek was a mistake. He was clearly past his prime and did not perform well with the team.

#  Do you think that Hasek can help the Orioles make a playoff run?

Dennis Hasek is a former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1990 to 2009. He is best known for his years with the Buffalo Sabres, where he won the Vezina Trophy six times. On July 1, 2014, Hasek signed a one-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB).

Hasek had not played baseball since he was a child, but he worked out with the Orioles in spring training and impressed the team with his athleticism and strong throwing arm. He made his debut with the Orioles on July 16, 2014, pitching one inning of relief against the Boston Red Sox and striking out David Ortiz.

The Orioles were in last place in the American League East Division at the time, but Hasek's addition provided a boost to the team and they went on to make a surprising playoff run. In eight appearances for the Orioles, Hasek had a 2.84 ERA and struck out nine batters.

#  What kind of impact do you think Hasek will have on the Baltimore Orioles' goaltending situation?

The Baltimore Orioles signed goaltender Dominik Hasek to a one-year contract on January 1, 2010. The move came as a bit of a surprise, as the team already had two quality goaltenders in Michael Saunders and Chris Tillman. The Orioles have not released information about what the signing means for the other two goaltenders on the roster, but it is safe to say that there will be some kind of impact.

Hasek is a six-time Vezina Trophy winner and has been one of the best goaltenders in the league for over a decade. He last played in the NHL during the 2008-09 season, when he spent time with both Detroit and Ottawa. He is now 43 years old and may be past his prime, but he should still be able to provide some valuable experience to the Baltimore goaltending corps.

Saunders and Tillman are both young goaltenders who are still learning their trade. Saunders has only played in 15 NHL games, while Tillman has just 11 starts under his belt. Bringing in Hasek will give them someone to learn from and could help them take their game to the next level.

Hasek is not likely to see much playing time with Baltimore, but he could still play an important role on the team. He can teach the young goalies how to handle themselves under pressure and how to stay focused during long seasons. He can also show them how to properly prepare for games and how to deal with difficult opponents.

Overall, I think Hasek's signing will be good for the Orioles' goaltending situation. He can teach the young goaltenders some valuable lessons that they can use both now and in the future.

#  How much do you think Hasek will play for the Orioles this season?

As of right now, it is undetermined how much Dominik Hasek will play for the Orioles this season. Orioles manager Buck Showalter hasn't given a solid answer, but he has hinted that the team is looking to give the veteran goalie around 10-15 games.

This season will be Hasek's 22nd in the NHL, and at 46 years old, it's fair to say that his playing days are slowly coming to an end. It'll be interesting to see how he performs in his return to the Orioles – last season with Detroit, he had a 3.44 goals against average and .901 save percentage.

Whether or not Hasek can still compete at a high level remains to be seen, but if he proves that he can still play well, it could be a major boost for the Orioles as they make their playoff push.

#  Are you surprised that the Baltimore Orioles were able to sign Dominik Hasek?

When news surfaced that the Baltimore Orioles signed free agent Dominik Hasek, many in the baseball community were surprised. It was thought that Hasek’s surgically repaired groin would keep him from playing competitively for at least another year.

But it seems that Hasek is determined to play and has been working hard to get back into game shape. Orioles’ general manager Mike Flanagan is confident that Hasek can be a valuable asset to the team.

“We are extremely happy to be able to add a player of Dominik’s caliber to our organization,” Flanagan said in a statement. “He is one of the greatest goaltenders in NHL history and we believe he still has something left to give. We look forward to having him join us in Baltimore and helping us make a run at the playoffs.”

Hasek, who retired from the NHL after last season, says he is excited about his new opportunity.

“I am very pleased to be able to sign with the Baltimore Orioles and have the chance to compete for a championship,” Hasek said in a statement. “The Orioles are an up-and-coming team with a lot of talent and I am looking forward to being a part of it. I can promise my fans that I will give everything I have left in my tank and will do everything I can to help this team win games.”

The Orioles are coming off of their first division championship in 15 years and appear poised to make another run at the playoffs this season. Adding Dominik Hasek could be just what they need to take them over the top.
