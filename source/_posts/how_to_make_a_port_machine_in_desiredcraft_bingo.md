# How to Make a Slot Machine in DesiredCraft

Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game where players can build and create their own virtual worlds. One of the many things players can create in Minecraft is a slot machine. Slot machines can add an extra layer of excitement and fun to your Minecraft world. In this article, we will walk you through the steps on how to make a slot machine in DesiredCraft.

## Step 1: Gather Resources
Before you start building your slot machine, you will need to gather resources. You will need the following:

- 3 Hoppers
- 3 Chests
- 2 Redstone Repeaters
- 1 Redstone Comparator
- 3 Redstone Dust
- 1 Button
- Building Blocks (any material of your choice)

## Step 2: Build the Slot Machine Frame
First, you will need to build the frame for your slot machine. You can use any material you like, but we recommend using something that looks good and fits the theme of your Minecraft world.

- Start by building a 3x3 frame using your building blocks.
- On the front of the frame, place a button in the center block.

## Step 3: Add the Hoppers and Chests
Next, you will need to add the hoppers and chests that will power the slot machine.

- Place a chest in the top right and bottom left corner of the frame.
- Place a hopper facing into each chest.
- Place a hopper facing into the center block of the frame.

## Step 4: Add the Redstone
Now it's time to add the redstone that will power the slot machine.

- Place a redstone comparator facing out of the center block of the frame.
- Place a redstone repeater facing into the center block of the frame from each side.
- Place redstone dust on top of each of the hoppers.

## Step 5: Testing the Slot Machine
Now that your slot machine is built, it's time to test it out!

- Put items in the chest on the top right and bottom left corners.
- Press the button in the center of the frame.
- If the items in the chest match, they will be dispensed into the hopper in the center block of the frame.
