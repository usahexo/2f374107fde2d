#  Hollywood Casino Amphitheater to Play Host to Good Poker Hands

With the resurgence of popularity in Texas Holdem, Hollywood Casino Amphitheater has decided to cash in on the opportunity to have some very big poker names come and play in their venue.

Aptly titled, “Good Poker Hands,” the event is set to take place over Labor Day Weekend, with festivities lasting from Thursday night all the way through Monday morning. Players scheduled to appear include Phil Ivey, Antonio Esfandiari, and Daniel Negreanu.

While many other casinos are looking to attract these world-renowned players for high-stakes cash games, Hollywood is instead opting for a tournament format. The buy-in is set at $10,000, with a guaranteed prize pool of $1 million.

The hope is that this event will not only draw in well-known players but also plenty of amateurs looking to test their skills against some of the best in the business. With increasing numbers of people taking up poker as a hobby, this could be an excellent opportunity for them to see how they compare.

Tournament director Sean McIntyre is excited about what this event can offer players of all levels. “We really wanted to put together an epic poker weekend that would cater to all types of players,” he said. “There will be something for everyone at Good Poker Hands.”

This sentiment was echoed by Hollywood Casino spokesperson Nicole Hensley who said that they are “thrilled to welcome some of the biggest names in poker to our property this Labor Day Weekend.” She also noted that there will be plenty of other activities available for guests who may not be interested in poker, including concerts and barbeques.

#  Good Poker Hands to Play at Hollywood Casino Amphitheater

There is no need to be intimidated by the typical casino poker games such as Texas Hold’em and Omaha. Hollywood Casino Amphitheater offers 1-3 No Limit Texas Hold’em Poker tables which are great for beginner players.

The following are good starting hands for beginning poker players at Hollywood Casino Amphitheater:

1. Starting with Aces is always a good idea in any game. If you are playing at a table that has more than six players, however, consider folding if the flop does not provide you with any help.

2. King-Queen is also a strong hand, as it can make a strong pair or trips (three of a kind). With this hand, you want to see the flop before committing too much money to the pot.

3. Another great starting hand is 10-10, as it is two pairs which give you a lot of potential winning combinations. Play conservatively with this hand until you know what the other players are holding.

4. Pair your 9s with an Ace or King to create two powerful pairs. This hand gives you a lot of betting versatility and should be played aggressively preflop and on the flop if possible.

These are just a few examples of good hands to play at Hollywood Casino Amphitheater – remember to use caution when playing any hand, especially if there are several active players at the table. By playing smart and using these tips, you can give yourself the best chance to win some money while enjoying an evening at the casino!
