The gambling industry is one that has been around for centuries, with different forms of it popping up in different parts of the world. Gambling can be traced back to ancient China and Greece, where there were games of chance played in both societies. Today, gambling is a multibillion-dollar industry, with different types of gambling being enjoyed by people all over the world.

There are two main types of gambling: casino gaming and sports betting. Casino gaming is the type that takes place in a physical location, such as a casino or racetrack, while sports betting takes place online or through a bookmaker.

Both forms of gambling are popular, but casino gaming is by far the most popular. In 2017, casino gaming generated $47.5 billion in revenue worldwide, while sports betting generated just $5.5 billion. This is largely due to the fact that it is much easier to bet on sports than it is to gamble at a casino. 

The global market for casino gaming is expected to grow at a rate of 3.2% over the next five years, reaching a value of $55.9 billion by 2022. This growth will be driven by increasing demand from emerging markets such as China and India. The market for sports betting is expected to grow at a rate of 5%, reaching a value of $7.1 billion by 2022. 

Casino gaming companies are among the top ten payors of income taxes in the world. In 2017, their total taxes paid amounted to $12.8 billion. This was second only to technology companies, which paid $13.6 billion in taxes. 

The tax payments made by casino gaming companies are not just limited to income taxes; they also pay significant amounts of taxes on their profits. In 2017, they paid $5.5 billion in profit taxes, making them the sixth largest payor of profit taxes in the world. 

The high tax payments made by casino gaming companies are due to the fact that they are very profitable businesses with large margins. In 2017, their average profit margin was 24%. This compares favorably to other industries, such as retail (4%) and technology (14%). 

The profitability and high tax payments of casino gaming companies make them an attractive investment for investors looking for high-yielding stocks. Their stock prices tend to be stable and they provide investors with dividends that are higher than average.
