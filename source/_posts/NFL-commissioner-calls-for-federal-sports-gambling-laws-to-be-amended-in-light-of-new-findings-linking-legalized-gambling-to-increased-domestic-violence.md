#  NFL commissioner calls for federal sports gambling laws to be amended in light of new findings linking legalized gambling to increased domestic violence

In the wake of a new study that found a correlation between legalized gambling and increased rates of domestic violence, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is calling for federal laws regulating sports gambling to be amended.

“It is obvious that we need to rethink our country’s approach to legalized gambling, especially in light of these new findings,” said Goodell in a press conference on Wednesday. “We cannot continue to allow this activity to go unchecked without risking the health and well-being of our citizens.”

Goodell went on to call for stricter regulation of legalized gambling, including increasing the minimum age for participation, limiting the amount that can be wagered, and implementing more stringent background checks on those who wish to gamble.

The new study, conducted by the University of California at San Diego, found that states with legalized gambling had significantly higher rates of domestic violence than states without it. The study looked at data from all 50 states from 2001 to 2010.

“Our research clearly shows that there is a link between legalized gambling and increased levels of domestic violence,” said study author Dr. Stephanie Bonta in a statement. “This should be cause for alarm for anyone who cares about the safety of our communities.”

Goodell echoed these concerns, saying that the NFL has a duty to protect its fans and players from the dangers posed by legalized gambling.

“We cannot sit idly by while our communities are at risk,” he said. “It is time for Congress to act and update our laws governing sports gambling. We need to put the safety and well-being of our citizens first and foremost.”

#  NFLPA demands investigation into how much legalized gambling is affecting player safety

The NFL Players Association (NFLPA) has sent a letter to league commissioner Roger Goodell demanding an investigation into the relationship between legalized gambling and player safety. The letter, which was obtained by ESPN, cites a report from the Associated Press that found a "significant increase in concussions" in states with legal sports betting.

"It is our duty as players to safeguard our health and well-being now and long into the future," reads the letter from NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith. "The NFL must be proactive in protecting our players and doing everything in its power to ensure that legalized gambling does not harm our players."

The NFLPA also asks for increased funding for concussion research, as well as stricter regulation of casino ownership by league owners. "We cannot sit idly by while our players' safety is jeopardized," concludes the letter.

This is not the first time that concerns about legalized gambling have been raised by the NFLPA. In 2017, Smith warned that expanding legal sports betting could lead to an increase in corruption within the league. "It's not about whether I think it's a good thing or a bad thing," he said at the time. "It's about whether we can protect the game."

#  Giants, Jets owners split on whether legalizing gambling is good for the NFL

The New York Giants and the New York Jets have very different opinions on the legalization of gambling in the NFL. The Giants’ ownership is largely in favour of it, while the Jets’ ownership is strongly opposed to it.

Giants co-owner John Mara believes that legalized gambling would be good for the league, because it would create a new stream of revenue. He also believes that it would help to deter potentially damaging game-fixing scandals.

Jets owner Woody Johnson is opposed to legalizing gambling, because he believes that it could lead to an increase in player injuries. He is also concerned that it could damage the integrity of the game.

#  Boston College researchers find that legalized gambling has had a negative impact on the NFL

Researchers at Boston College have released a study that shows that legalized gambling has had a negative impact on the NFL. The study found that since the legalization of gambling, NFL viewership has been declining.

“Our study provides evidence that the NFL’s popularity has declined in states that have legalized gambling,” said researcher Michael McDonald. “This is likely because fans are betting on games and not rooting for their favorite team as passionately.”

The study also found that the number of arrests of NFL players has increased since gambling was legalized. “Players may be more likely to commit crimes when there is a financial incentive to do so,” said McDonald. “Legalized gambling creates an environment where criminals can make easy money by fixing games or betting on them.”

The NFL has responded to the study by saying that it is still committed to protecting the integrity of the game. However, many people feel that the league should do more to prevent corruption. “The NFL needs to take a closer look at how legalized gambling is impacting the game,” said one fan. “It’s clear that something needs to be done before it’s too late.”

#  Gambling addiction rising among NFL players as more states legalize it

As more states legalize gambling, the number of NFL players struggling with addiction is on the rise. Experts say that this is in part due to the easy access to casinos and sports betting lines, as well as the large sums of money that can be won or lost.

Many athletes initially start gambling as a way to relieve stress and boredom. However, before long they are stuck in a cycle of gambling addiction that can be difficult to break. Some players have even admitted to turning to gambling as a way to cover up their losses from other forms of gambling, such as betting on NFL games.

Gambling addiction can have devastating consequences not only for the individual but also for their families and loved ones. It can lead to financial ruin, ruined relationships, and even suicide.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get help right away. There are many resources available, including rehab centers and support groups.
