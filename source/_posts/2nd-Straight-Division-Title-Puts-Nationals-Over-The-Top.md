#  2nd Straight Division Title Puts Nationals Over The Top

The Washington Nationals have now won back-to-back National League East Division titles, following their victory over the Miami Marlins this past Sunday.

It was an interesting season for the Nationals, as they had to deal with a great number of injuries. Star players such as Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg, Daniel Murphy and Trea Turner all had stints on the disabled list at some point during the year.

Despite this, manager Dave Martinez was able to keep his team focused and in contention until the very end. And now that they have finally clinched the division title, the Nationals can begin to prepare for another deep playoff run.

This is a team that is capable of going all the way, as they have proved in both 2016 and 2017. Harper is once again in excellent form, and Strasburg is looking like his old self after returning from injury.

The addition of Murphy in the offseason also paid dividends, as he batted .322 with 13 homers and 53 RBIs in just 73 games.

The Nationals will now face off against the Brewers in the NLDS. Milwaukee was one of the surprise teams in baseball this year, but they should not be taken lightly. The Brewers are led by MVP candidate Christian Yelich and veteran slugger Ryan Braun.

Washington will need to play their best ball if they want to advance to the NLCS. But with this team, anything is possible. Be sure to catch all of the action as the Nationals attempt to bring a World Series championship back to D.C.!

#  Harper, Strasburg Lead Washington To Another NL East Crown

Just another day at the ballpark for the Washington Nationals.

The Nationals clinched their fourth National League East division title in six years on Tuesday, thanks to a 6-2 win over the Miami Marlins.

Bryce Harper and Stephen Strasburg led the way for Washington, with Harper hitting two home runs and Strasburg pitching seven innings of two-run ball.

"It's a great feeling," said Harper. "We have a great team and to do it in front of our home fans is pretty special."

Washington will now head into the playoffs as one of the favorites to win the World Series. They'll open up against the winner of Wednesday's game between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs.

#  Scherzer Wins 20 Games; Nats Clinch 3rd Straight NL East Division Title

Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer won his twentieth game of the season on Wednesday night, as the Nationals beat the Miami Marlins 9-4. With the victory, Scherzer became just the sixth pitcher in major league history to win at least 20 games in six consecutive seasons.

"It feels really good," Scherzer said after the game. "I'm really proud of what this team has been able to do. We've battled through a lot of injuries and suspensions and we're still here, playing our best baseball."

The Nationals' win clinched their third consecutive National League East division title. It is the first time in franchise history that Washington has won three straight division titles.

"This is a great accomplishment," said Nationals Manager Dave Martinez. "But our goal is to win a World Series, so we still have a lot of work to do."

Scherzer will get one more chance to add to his win total when he starts against the Marlins on Sunday. If he wins that game, he will become just the fifth pitcher in major league history to notch 20 or more wins in seven consecutive seasons.

#  Washington Nationals Win Fifth Straight NL East Division Title

The Washington Nationals are the National League East Division Champions for the fifth consecutive season. This marks the first time in franchise history that they have won five consecutive division titles. The Nationals finished the regular season with a record of 98-64, which was good for first place in the NL East.

Washington's success this season can be attributed to their strong starting pitching. Their starters led all of baseball with a combined 3.34 ERA. Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg were both dominant this year, and both were named to the NL All-Star team. Scherzer won his second Cy Young Award this season, while Strasburg finished third in the voting.

The Nationals also had a potent lineup this year, led by Bryce Harper and Anthony Rendon. Harper hit .319 with 37 home runs and 100 RBIs, while Rendon hit .308 with 24 home runs and 92 RBIs. The Nationals will need those two to continue to produce at a high level if they want to make it deep into the playoffs.

Washington's bullpen was also one of the best in baseball this year. They had a collective 3.38 ERA, which was the third lowest in all of baseball. Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson were both dominant out of the bullpen, and they will be critical pieces for Washington in the playoffs.

The Nationals will face off against the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Division Series. The Brewers are a very dangerous team, but if Washington's starting pitching can stay sharp, they should be able to advance to the next round.

#  Bryce Harper And Max Scherzer Lead Washington Nationals To Third Straight NL East Title

Entering the 2018 MLB season, the Washington Nationals were +650 to win the NL East. Oddsmakers clearly didn't believe in the team's ability to three-peat as division champions with Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer leading the way.

But that's exactly what Washington did, edging out the Atlanta Braves by seven games to clinch their third straight division title.

For Scherzer, it was his sixth consecutive NL East championship â€” a record for any pitcher in MLB history. And Harper continued his onslaught against division rivals, hitting .315 with 34 homers and 100 RBIs against NL East opponents over the past three seasons.

"It means a lot," Harper said after the team's final game of the season. "We battled all year long. It wasn't easy, but we did it."

The Nationals will now face off against the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series starting on Thursday.
