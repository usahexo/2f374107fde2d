In Guam, one particular slot machine has been drawing in players thanks to its unique feature – the ability to win back any amount of money wagered.</p>
<p>This slot machine, which is known as the Money Ball Slot Machine, was recently introduced at the Dusit Thani Guam Resort. It works by allowing players to win back any amount of money that they have wagered, up to a maximum of $100.

One player, who goes by the name of “sniper” on the gaming forum Slot Fanatics, said that he had played the machine and won back $80 of the $100 he had originally wagered. He went on to say that he thought it was a great game and would definitely be playing it again.</p>
<p>Another player, known as “Smitty” on Slot Fanatics, said that he also enjoyed playing the Money Ball Slot Machine. According to him, it was a very fun game with decent payouts. He also said that he had managed to win back $60 of the $100 he had originally wagered.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that the Money Ball Slot Machine is living up to its name by giving players the chance to win back some or all of their money. If you’re looking for a slot machine with a unique feature, then this could be just what you’re looking for. Head down to the Dusit Thani Guam Resort and give it a try!</p>
