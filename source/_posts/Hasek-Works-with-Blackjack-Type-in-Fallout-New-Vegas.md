#  Hasek's Blackjack Type Overview for Fallout New Vegas

The goal of Hasek's blackjack is to reach the number 21 or come closer to it than the dealer, without going over. In order to achieve this players must make educated decisions about when to hit and when to stand.

In Fallout New Vegas, Hasek's blackjack can be played at any of the casinos. However, in order to participate in a game, players must first purchase chips from the casino cage. The minimum bet at most casinos is 100 chips, and the maximum bet is 10,000 chips.

Players are dealt two cards face up and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down. Players can either take another card (hit) or stay with their current total (stand). The goal is to reach 21 or come closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

If a player goes over 21, they bust and lose regardless of what the dealer does. If both players have the same total (a push), neither player wins or loses money.

If you're ever unsure what action to take, remember these tips:

-Hit if your total is below 17
-Stand if your total is 17 or higher 
-Hit if you have a soft hand (an Ace counted as 11) 
-Stand if you have a hard hand (an Ace counted as 1)
